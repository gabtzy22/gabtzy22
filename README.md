ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Cezzann Gabrielle N. Amido, 2nd Year BSIT-MWA Student in National University - Manila
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m highly interested in Esports and Gaming
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking BS in Mobile and Web Application Development
ðŸ“« If interested in any collaborations, email me at Cezzann69@gmail.com

P.S: GitHub decided to give me 2FA problems preventing me from accessing and using my own account normally. Not to mention SMS isn't an option because Philippines' number is NOT AVAILABLE!
Thank you GitHub.
